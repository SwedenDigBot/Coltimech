Sister Project, Wall-Art Mechanism

Have you seen a telescopic robot arm? Check the web, They're virtually non-existent. The designs are weird. The field is barely explored. The nearest commercial use is telescopic hydraulic crane booms with 3 to 45 ton hoisting limits. 

Kevlar reinforced timing belts are favored for CNC, automatic gearboxes, cambelts, lawnmower drives, 3D printing, sawmills, photocopiers, articulated robots and 50 other common machines. 

Let’s be the first to fabricate telescopic power limbs with them. Trial and error can reveal a new technology for home projects, with major advantages over other kinds of robot arm. 
It is a difficult job with interesting new challenges.

Wires can be hidden in a chain cable carrier to the side. The linear slide rail can use large steel wheels that are easy to access and tidy, resistant to paint, quartz and water. 

What would it be used for outdoors? Artwork seems to be a popular occupation that city youth struggle with. Perhaps we can help youth stop their tags and learn robotics, and in the process, find a way forwards for chemical free cultivator robots. 


A 3d printer can create plastic prototypes, to be powered with spare 3D printer motors. A lot easier than an articulated arm to assemble, holding a magic marker dampened by a spring, you would own the world’s very first mini pen-plotter robot that is portable and fits in your backpack. 

Stainless steel laser-cut designs would be very resistant and scalable. 

A 50 cm arm with a reach of 120cm, would print wall art of 180 cm diameter. 
A 100 cm arm with a reach of 200cm, would print wall art 400cm diameter.
Weighing 25 kilos, it could be affixed to a roof rack, the car jacked with a wood block, as a source of revenue tending companies and cities that want vibrant wall art and publicity.
A theoretical 2 mm precision for a 200 cm artwork is 1000 pixels of diameter, not bad.
That sounds very difficult from telescopic rails, is it possible? It will have the same wobble and deceleration issues of the RepRap project. 
Pointillism and Roy Lichtenstein artwork can be achieved with a sponge paint deposition system, one or multiple sponges that are supplied with drips of paint. 

Complex color systems require mixed paint, RGB+Black adaptive nozzles that can be fed by small motors. The paint jet doesn’t have to be powerful, just 1-10 cm distance, so it can be 3D printed, and powered with a compressed air bottle, or a 3D printed compressor.

A curtain over the front end of the arm should keep it free of paint airborn paint, and adaptable shields will also work fine. 
A CMOS to set markers on the wall for drawing pictures of 200cm and 1000cm in multiple steps could be good too.

Technical info for the arm is available in chapter 4 of ![this book](https://github.com/SwedenDigBot/Coltimech/blob/main/Roboto%20Coltimech%20garden%20reprap%20v08b.pdf) called "A New Robot Arm"
